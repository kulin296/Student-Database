# Student-Database
This project implements a Student Data Management System in C using a singly linked list. It allows users to manage student records, including adding, displaying, updating, and deleting student details such as name, roll number and marks. The singly linked list structure is used to store student data dynamically, with each student represented as a node linked to the next.
Key features include:
Adding new student records at the beginning or end or middle of the list.
Searching for students by roll number.
Displaying all student records.
Updating or deleting student records.
Counting the total number of students.
This project demonstrates the use of dynamic memory allocation, linked list operations, and efficient data management without the need for contiguous memory blocks.
